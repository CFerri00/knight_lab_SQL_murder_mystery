Morty Schapiro	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Annabel Miller	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

Jeremy Bowers	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

> Based on the killer's interview transcript I searched for an individual matching the description of between 65 to 67 inches in height, red hair, drives a Tesla Model S and attended the SQL Symphony concert three times in December of 2017. 
This led me to a one Miranda Priestly. Ms Priestly stands at 66", exactly within the range provided by our killer, and indeed makes a lot of money at $310,000 annually.
